# ShaarliGo

self-hosted microblogging inspired by
http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli. Destilled down to the bare
minimum, with easy hosting and security in mind. No PHP, no DB, no server-side
templating.

## Design Goals

* standards compliant ([Atom](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287), 
  [Atompub](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023), 
  [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/)),
* keep server lean, especially for readers,
* easy migration from existing shaarlis,
* backwards compatible posting (https://github.com/mro/Shaarli-API-test/)
* trivial installation and minimal hosting requirements (run on simple hosted webspace),
* run ok without javascript,
* visitor reading operates on static flat files only (no server code),
* secure against brute force login attacks,
* easy translation & skinning,
* leverage existing, widely deployed web tec ([XSLT](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-10/), HTML, CSS),
* easy fail2ban integration / DOS mitigation,
