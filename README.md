# ShaarliGo

self-hosted microblogging inspired by
http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli. Destilled down to the bare
minimum, with easy hosting and security in mind. No PHP, no DB, no server-side
templating, JS optional.

## Design Goals

- [ ] standards compliant ([Atom](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287),
  [Atompub](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023),
  [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/)),
- [x] keep server lean, especially for readers,
- [ ] easy migration from existing shaarlis,
- [x] backwards compatible posting (https://github.com/mro/Shaarli-API-test/)
- [x] trivial installation and minimal hosting requirements (run on simple hosted webspace),
- [x] run ok without javascript,
- [x] visitor reading operates on static flat files only (no server code),
- [ ] secure against brute force login attacks,
- [x] easy translation & skinning,
- [x] leverage existing, widely deployed web tec ([XSLT](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-10/), HTML, CSS),
- [ ] easy fail2ban integration / DOS mitigation,
